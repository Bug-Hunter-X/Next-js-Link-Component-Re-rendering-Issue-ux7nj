# Next.js Link Component Re-rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a re-rendering issue encountered when using the Next.js Link component for navigation.  When navigating between pages, the content of the previous page doesn't always re-render properly.

## Problem Description

The issue occurs when navigating from the home page to the about page and back. The home page content might not update correctly if it involves data fetching or dynamic elements. The UI might remain stale, showing the previous state.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `router.replace()` method in conjunction with the `useEffect()` hook in the home page component. This ensures that the home page is completely re-rendered when navigating back from the about page.  This approach forces a full re-render of the home page and avoids the potential caching or re-hydration issues.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate from the home page to the about page, and then back to the home page. Observe the potential re-rendering issue.
